        "desc": "The Verneuil Method, otherwise known by the trade name “Flame Fusion”, is a widely used and classic method of quick quality crystal production. It has a limited range of materials in which can be produced with it, but it allows very fast and very cheap growth. Finished boules can be grown in a matter of hours. The tradeoff is that they can be prone to impurities or defects in some situations. As such, it doesn’t tend to grow optics-quality material; However, it still produces gem-grade crystals. Certain materials (Such as Rutile) can be grown to optics-purity via careful parameter control and post-processing, such as annealing.<br>The general process for growth is very simple. It’s not unlike a plasma sputtering device. Solid ingredients are liquified and sputtered at high speeds and temperatures towards a base or a seed crystal. After several hours, this buildup of microscopic molten droplets quickly crystallizes into a solid boule.",
