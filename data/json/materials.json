        "desc": "Corundum is one of the most common synthetic materials grown today. It's an extremely versatile product with exceptional properties. In nature, this material is often known by the variety names Sapphire and Ruby. It is sought after because of its optimal hardness and variety of possible colorations. Add on the fact that it's easy to produce, and it's not hard to see why it's one of the most popular materials in the world for both scientific and gemological use.<br><br>As far as synthetic corundum, some of the most common usecases involve specialty optics, such as in Thermal Sensors, Lasers, High-Durability Screens / Viewports, Specialty Lenses, and even in Weaponry / Imaging systems.<br><br>Corundum can also be used in Machining, Bearings, and Polishing. Furthermore, Alumina Ceramics (Microcorundum crystals suspended in solid alumina) are also extensively used across the industry. Most commonly they're used as a high-temperature ceramic barrier, but have also seen use in grinding or even in sintering to produce extremely large optical boules.<br><br>Part of the reason for its wide availability and use is how easy it is to produce. It can be synthesized using a massive variety of methods, some not even listed here. Not to mention, alumina is cheap and easy to purify, making production even simpler. See below for a list of common production methods.",

Add on the fact that hydrothermally, it grows with nil to no inclusions (unlike beryl), it is quite optimal for both industrial and gemological use.<br><br>Most commonly, you'll find synthetic quartz used within Piezoelectrics, where it's main attraction is. Quartz, when charged with the right current, outputs a nearly flawless sine wave. This aspect is what makes it so important for oscillators and timing circuits. Furthermore, you'll often come by synthetic quartz in just about any situation involving inert / high termperature surfaces. Quartz tubes and machined containers are extremely useful in chemical sciences, because quartz is far tougher and harder then normal glass, while also being even less susceptible to high temperatures. It still retains the optical clarity and chemical resistance of glass aswell.<br><br>Beyond just basic quartz in industrial and gemological use, quartz also has quite a few artificial varieties that come in different colors. Some have even managed to recreate transitional zoning.

Synthetic rutile has often been described as 'Crystallized RGB' because it expresses so much color that it's almost overwhelming in a professionally cut stone. It's high refractive index also makes it extremely refractive, which further excentuates the dispersion.<br><br>An unfortunate pairing for rutile is its difficulty in production. Rutile is grown using the most common method for corundum and spinel, but unlike them, it's not easy or affordable in any way. Resulting boules are often extremely defective or riddled with errors. Many times the finished crystals have to heat-treated / annealed to be optically clear, and even after that they may still be unusable. It has some important uses as a piezoelectric and in niche optics, so a lot of defect material often leeches into the synthetic market. This is why weve managed to have so many pure cut rutiles in the niche part of the gem world, even if they cost a small fortune. Unfortunately, even with how attractive these specimens are, the complexities of production and softness / weakness of the material would make it very unappealing to be mass-produced, so it's unlikely that it'll ever get cheaper or become popular in the gem industry.",
